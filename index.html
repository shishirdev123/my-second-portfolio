            <p class="my-paragraph">I have been learning HTML since 2020. By 2022 I have acquired fairly good skills on HTML. I have created several normal websites with HTML only. But I don't know how successful I have been but I tried my best. HTML tags & Attributes were also very difficult to remember at first but now it has come under control. I wish everyone prayers</p>

            <p class="my-paragraph">Since 2020 I have been learning to build websites by both HTML and CSS. At first it was very difficult for me but I am currently a junior web developer in collaboration with Programming Hero. I am very happy and satisfied with their help. I hope you, like me, can one day become a web developer and be able to build the career of your dreams. Thank You</p>
